# Jquery UI Scroll Spinner Plugin

The Scroll Spinner Plugin is an alternative to the spinner widget included with
jQuery UI. Instead of having always visible control buttons for manipulating the
value, the current value displays a dropdown indicator which when clicked opens
an infinitely scrolling select list with numbers. As with the original spinner
input, the desired value can also be input using the keyboard.
